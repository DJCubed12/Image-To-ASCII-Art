# Image-To-ASCII-Art
Converts .png or .jpg images to text files of ASCII art. Uses a GUI created with tkinter to accomplish this.

This project is dependant on Pillow. Unfortunately, I was not so good at version control and managing environments at the time, so all I can say is that Python 3.8 works. However, current versions of Python and Pillow should function the same for the most part.
